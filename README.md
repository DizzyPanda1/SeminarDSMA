## Managerial Summary
This study examines Decathlon, the world's largest sports retailer, aiming to boost its brand image and customer satisfaction. Analyzing 170,000 customer reviews and 46 million transactions, the focus is on identifying areas of excellence and improvement, particularly concerning product returns, a major issue affecting customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and sustainability. The research centers on Decathlon's Passion brands across five key departments: Hiking, Biking, Water sports, Swimming, and Snow sports. Insights from customer reviews shed light on experiences and reasons for product returns.

Key issues identified include size and fit, product quality, delivery, and staff performance, notably in the biking department. Proposed solutions include introducing a virtual fitting room, enhancing product information on the homepage, and streamlining delivery processes.

Implementing a virtual fitting room can notably reduce returns due to size and fit issues, offering customers the chance to virtually try products before purchase. This technology not only enhances customer experience but also elevates Decathlon's brand image as a customer-centric and technologically advanced retailer.

Comprehensive and easily accessible product information can manage customer expectations regarding product quality, aiding informed purchasing decisions. A review of delivery processes can address customer dissatisfaction, boosting trust, loyalty, and brand image, while also cutting operational costs and reducing carbon emissions.

This research empowers Decathlon to enhance its reputation, customer service, and market position, while promoting environmentally friendly practices. The findings are expected to reduce return-related expenses, manage quality expectations, and optimize delivery procedures.

## Measuring Brand Image
Product returns emerge as a suitable metric for measuring brand image. They directly reflect customer satisfaction and significantly impact financial and environmental aspects. By addressing returns, Decathlon can bolster customer satisfaction, financial resilience, and environmental responsibility.

## Identifying Improvement Areas
Leveraging daily collected reviews, topic analysis is employed to identify prevalent issues affecting product returns. This approach allows for a targeted strategy to address customer pain points effectively.

## Delivering Solutions
Beyond identifying improvement areas, tailored solutions are proposed by analyzing reviews within each topic. This research aims to provide actionable insights to reduce returns, ensuring Decathlon maintains its status as a trusted and reliable sports retailer.
